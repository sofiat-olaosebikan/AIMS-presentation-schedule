# AIMS-presentation-schedule

This program was written to assign students to courses for short presentations during the Review Phase, 
at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Ghana, for the academic year 205/2016. 

There are 48 students, and this deterministic algorithm assigns students to their preference according to how early 
their response was received. Each students has an opportunity to choose up to 3 courses from most preferred to least preferred, and the algorithm assigns students to their preference accordingly, with the condition that not more than 3 students can be assigned to a course. Thus if a student's most preferred course is not available, they are assigned to their least preferred...If all the preferences a student selected is filled, such student is not assigned. However, with the way the program was written, such students can be tracked.
