 """
A program that assigns students to courses for presentation during the Review phase at AIMS-Ghana, 2015.
The algorithm is deterministic, students are assigned courses according to how early their response was received.
Each students has an opportunity to choose up to 3 courses from most preferred to least preferred, and the algorithm
assigns students to their preference accordingly, with the condition that not more than 3 students can be assigned
to a course. Thus if a student's most preferred course is not available, they are assigned to their least preferred...
